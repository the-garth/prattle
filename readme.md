####What is Prattle?
Prattle is GA's very own alternative to Slack. Prattle is especially popular with GA students whose slack channel is being disconnected on Jan 13th. 
<br> 

Prattle is away for students to have unlimited messaging in order to stay in contact and build networks. 
<br> 

###Frameworks:
Technically speaking, Prattle is built in rails with devise for authentication using private_pub and faye for socketChat. It also stores conversations in Postgresql. We also used thin for private_pub in development. 


#### Our Creation Process 
Here is a 'mock up board' which we thought we would try and base our site around.

###Responsive Design
Prattle is a fully responsive site over mobile, tablet and computer.

###Improvements
We would like to encoperate placeholder images using Carrierwave, mini-magic, fog and AWS for the storage.
